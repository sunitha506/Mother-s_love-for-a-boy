  <h4><i>Traveller asked him,</i></h4>
  <p> <i>“Hey Man! You are blind and can’t see anything! Why do you carry the lamp then?!”</i></p>
  <h4><i>The blind man replied,</i></h4>
  <p><i> “Yes, unfortunately, I am blind and I can’t see anything but a lighted lamp which I am carrying is for the people like you who can see.<br> You may not see the blind man coming and end up pushing me. That is why I carry a lighted lamp”.</i></p>
  <p><i>"The group of travellers felt ashamed<br> and apologized for their behaviour."</i></p>
